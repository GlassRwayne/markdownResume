## Hobbies and Interests  
 
**Water Sculpting**  
> Ever since being a child and beginning with simple swirls in a stream or a fountain, my interest in the forms and shapes that water can take. One might think that water being transitive in nature that such sculptures made would disappear in the flow of time. Without the skills learned under long practice under the tutelage of specialized masters of the element of Water, these skills would be but the fleeting dreams of a waking child. Though, even upon becoming a master sculptor, it is the very nature of those dreams that must become one's closest of kin.   
 
**Archeology** 
> The abilities of the Anthropological Archeologist are highly developed through years of social interactions and being able to hone skills of keen observation. A strong interest of history and the lives people led; their beliefs, work, family, ideals, modes, and artistic endeavors that shaped their world; all of which hold a strong interest, which can also shape the world that we may create in the now and future for ourselves. Traditions carried forward, and wisdom learned is something that brings growth to our own evolution 
 
**Saving the World**
> One might wake up one morning and say to oneself, I think I will go save the world today! Sounds great, until one goes out the door in that morning and takes in the width and depth of said world surrounding one small insignificant bug in the grand schemes. One soon learns that it helps to find a problem, and perhaps a good plan of action would be helpful. However, one also soon learns that all too many people and creatures are just fine with the current state of their lives and not only do not want to be saved, but are highly resistant to some idealistic do-gooder mucking everything up. Unless you have some imminent danger of the type where the Moons are hurtling toward our impending demise, you will be hard pressed to get your best laid plans off to a good start. As the wise saying goes, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, unless you meet a bear, then it will just kill you anyway. Keep that in mind when venturing off on your quests.
